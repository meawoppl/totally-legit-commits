Go Vote
#######

This is a silly github project to encourage people to go vote.
It could be easily adopted to send other messages, but that is
an exercise left to the reader.

4. Run the base.py script, and enter some-madeup-name when prompted.

# I would love to have more ascii graphics :)
# I am not sure this works in all localizations, given start of week semantics.
# Tested in Python 3.4, might work in 2.7?
